let age = 30;
//re-assign or mutated the age variable
age = 31;
//to mutate, we use let

// const -> variable that cannot be mutated.
const birthYear = 1995;

//we cannot use empty const variable at declaration, have to give them a value;
//  e.g. const job;

//Using var
var job = 'Programmer';
job = 'Pilot';

//let is block-scoped and var is function-scoped. --> VERY IMPORTANT

//Exercise
let language = 'Hindi';
const birthPlace = 'Delhi';
const birthHospital = 'St. Stephens';
language = 'English';
